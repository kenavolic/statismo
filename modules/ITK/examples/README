Simple examples showing the use of statismo from ITK.
See the runITKExamples.sh file to see how to use the example programs or to run them directly (on unix).

NOTE:

All the example as all-in-one meaning you can copy paste it to have a working example
at the expense of some code reuse of course...

WARNING: 

The code standard (error handling, coding style and performance) for these examples
is lower than the true user utilities found in cli. These examples can be seen as code snaphshots
that can be run!
