/**
 * \brief Provides the interface between statismo and the dataset type the application uses.
 *
 * A Representer is a type that provides the connection between the statismo library
 * and the application. It distinguishes three different representations of the data, and provides methods for
 * conversion between those representations:
 * - a Dataset, typically as read from a file on the disk
 * - a Sample, which is a geometric (generally a rigid or affine) transform of the dataset
 * - a SampleVector, which is an internal representation (vector) useful from the statistical analysis.
 *
 * A good starting point to define a new representer is to look at \a TrivialVectorialRepresenter
